<h1>Open Door</h1>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>You unlock and open the door, removing the only barrier that separates you from this being. </p>
        <p>It stands before you, watching you with its empty eyes.</p>
        <p>Your own face staring back, twisted into a grin that seems to stretch impossibly wider, as if the skin might tear.</p>
        <p>Its hand extends out. Not for the door. For you.</p>
        <p>For your skin.</p>
    </div>
