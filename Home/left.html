<h1>Go Left</h1>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>You turn left, heart pounding, diving into your bedroom. You slam the door shut behind you, hands shaking as you fumble for the lock.</p>
        <p>Your eyes dart around the room for something, anything that could save you.</p>
        <p>The window. Itâ€™s your only way out.</p>
        <p>You lunge for it, fingers barely brushing the latch when the door suddenly bursts open with a force that rattles the walls.</p>
        <p>It found you.</p>
        <p>Before you can scream, before you can even fight, it grabs you.</p>
        <p>Cold hands, inhumanly strong, pull you away in an instant. </p>
