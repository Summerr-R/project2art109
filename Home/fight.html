<h1>Fight</h1>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>You tear your gaze away and shove the thing with all your strength, desperation fueling your movements.</p>
        <p>It barely stumbles backwards.</p>
        <p>Before you can react, it lunges with its grin still plastered across its face, eyes locked onto you with something animalistic. Hungry.</p>
        <p>Cold fingers clamp around your wrist, an iron grip that sends a chill through your bones. With terrifying strength, it pushes you inside, slamming the door shut behind you. The walls of your own home, meant to protect you, now feel like a cage.</p>
        <p>You thrash, twist, try to break free, but it only tightens its grip. It’s enjoying this. Your struggle. Your fear. Like it’s playing with its food.</p>
        <p>An opening appears and you strike, landing a blow that sends it lurching backward. But instead of falling, its body folds.</p>
        <p>Its feet remain planted, but its spine bends unnaturally, snapping into a grotesque, upside-down arch.</p>
        <p>It doesn’t stop smiling.</p>
        <p>You don’t wait to see what happens next. You run.</p>
