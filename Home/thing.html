    <div>
        <p>The face staring back at a copy of your own.</p>
        <p>The features are identical—every line, every shadow—but something is wrong. The smile stretches just a little too wide, and the eyes remain empty. Hollow. Like a mask pretending to be human.</p>
        <p>The doorknob jerks violently. The wood trembles under heavy, frantic blows. The thing is trying to get in.</p>
        <p>Your breath catches in your throat. You stumble back, heart hammering.</p>
