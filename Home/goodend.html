        <p>You’ve survived.</p>
        <p>As of now, that soulless imitation of you is gone.</p>
        <p>It wanted to take your place, to be you. But why? What would it have done, living your life, wearing your face? The thought lingers, a gnawing unease that no amount of answers could ever satisfy.</p>
        <p>For now, you can rest.</p>
        <p>But no matter how much time passes, no matter how safe you feel,</p>
        <p>You’ll never forget this night.</p>
